# Fintech-website

This project was supposed to clone and mock a few of the [flutterwave's](https://flutterwave.com) website functionalities - a fintech.

Initially, this project was supposed to be a full-stack thing, with a backend developer; we couldn't do it due to unspecific reasons, and now, there's only the homepage of the website.

This was from June 2022.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`
